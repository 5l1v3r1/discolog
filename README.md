# Usage ðŸ¤–
How to install/run DiscoLog:

    Download this repository & Open 'start.bat'
      This will install all needed dependences & start DiscoLog.

Your console should open up, and you will see something like this:

From here, just insert your Discord Token. *(I will not explain how to get it)*

Also, don't worry! DiscoLog doesn't store **any** of your information.

Once you have completed that step, you will be asked which messages you would like to log:

Typing 'dm' (without quotes) will make DiscoLog *only* log your DM & GroupChat Messages.

Typing 'all' (without quotes) will make DiscoLog log ALL Messages sent, Including server chats & DMs/GCs.

For this, I'm going to select the all option!:

From here, you can choose to have the messages sent through a Discord Webhook or not using 'y' or 'n':

For this, I am going to choose yes *(y)*:

Now, all you have to do is go to your Discord Server, Create/Copy your Webhooks link, and Paste it into DiscoLog:

Boom! DiscoLog has now started logging the messages coming through to our Discord account.
